Timezone offset computation taking legal time as input.

This code is based on 3 sources:
- Olson : Olson database, used by php to provide timezone information.
          https://www.iana.org/time-zones
          Permits to handles cases when the tz offset is the same for a whole country.
          But does not permit to handle particular cases:
            - when legal time is local time (longitude of the city is needed),
            - mess generated by wars (legal time changes when a place is liberated).
- THM   : "Traité de l'heure dans le monde", (Gabriel, Guy Trédaniel éditeur), 5th edition, 1990
- FG    : "Problèmes de l'heure résolus pour le monde entier" (Françoise Gauquelin, Guy Trédaniel éditeur), 1991

Referred as Olson, THM and FG in the comments.

Code of this package contains computations for periods when offset computation depends on local conditions.
But sources sometimes diverge, and reliable and precise information can't be found on the internet.
In general, this implementation is very restrictive and refuses to handle ambiguous cases.
Exceptions to this rule are commented in the code.

Computations return offsets conform to ISO 8601 and Olson database :
(LT = legal time)
UT = LT - offset
or LT = UT + offset
This is the opposite of offsets given in both books (called DTU in THM).

Note that when using Olson database with $timezone->getOffset(), the field 'time' of an entry is given in UT.
As this package uses legal time as input, the limits are expressed in local time.
