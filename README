This database is the result of A RECONSTITUTION OF THE DATA USED TO PERFORM STATISTICAL TEST ON ASTROLOGY,
in practice published between 1955 and 1996.

It contains 25 000 birth dates of famous persons grouped by profession, with one particularity: BIRTH DATES CONTAIN THE TIME OF BIRTH.

A first part of the job has been done, but the database is still draft:
- Birth times need to be checked against civil registries.
- Timezone computation: implement for foreign countries (not FR) + fix by human dubious cases (wars).

The purpose of this database is to reproduct and extend the historical tests with more complete and reliable data,
to ask once again the questions:
- Can we observe statistical anomalies related to astrology ? 
- Did some protagonists of the historical tests cheat ?

Next developments:
- implement eminence computation for the different professional groups
- link with wikidata
- rewrite opengauquelin.org to build a convenient UI to fix errors and associate a person of the database to the image of a birth certificate.
