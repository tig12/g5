This directory contains human corrections that should be applied to database persons
Original files come from http://cura.free.fr/gauq/17archg.html ; stored in data/raw/cura.free.fr
Then converted to csv by step raw2csv
Then these yaml corrections are applied

Each yaml file contains a list of associations key: value

An element of the list looks like this :

-
  NUM: 123
  FNAME: A value
  DATE: '2019-10-15 23:16:50+02:00' 
  build-notes:
    - here free notes

Each element must contain at least a key NUM
If field NUM is not present, the record is not processed.
If field NUM is empty, the record is not processed.
Other keys must use the vocabulary described in
https://tig12.github.io/gauquelin5/output-format.html
One exception : key "build-notes" (lowercase) is ignored while processing.

WARNING : a limited subset of this vocabulary is implemented.
If new fields are needed, the code of src/commands/cura/all/tweaks2db.php must be modified.
Fields currently implemented :
FNAME
GNAME
DATE
C3

Dates should be surrounded by quotes (don't know for sure, but in case)

As empty NUM are ignored, a file can safely contain empty models like that :

-
  NUM: 
  FNAME: 
  DATE: ''
  build-notes:
    -
  
As YAML syntax allows free formatted fields, build notes can also be like this :
-
  NUM: 
  FNAME: 
  DATE: ''
  build-notes: |
    Build notes can be multiline
    as long as tabulation is respected
