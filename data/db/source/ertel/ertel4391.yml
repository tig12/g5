      Ertel notice: "Gauquelin mailed these sets to the author after his
      return from Paris. Inadvertently they had not been handed over. There are
      sports figures from former French colonies and fiom Paris anondissements
      where birth records were difficult to obtain. Gauquelin indicated he tried
      hard to obtain the data since the athletes in question were famous, and he
      was successful in 27 cases."
