  Ertel notice: "Gauquelin mailed these sets to the author after his
  return from Paris. Inadvertently they had not been handed over. There are
  sports figures from former French colonies and from Paris arrondissements
  where birth records were difficult to obtain. Gauquelin indicated he tried
  hard to obtain the data since the athletes in question were famous, and he
  was successful in 27 cases."
