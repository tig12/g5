This directory contains human corrections that should be applied to files of 5-cura-csv/
Original files come from http://cura.free.fr/gauq/17archg.html ; stored in 1-cura-raw
Then converted to csv by step raw2csv
Then these yaml corrections are applied

Each yaml file contains a list of associations key: value

An element of the list looks like this :

-
  NUM: 123
  FNAME: A value
  DATE: '2019-10-15 23:16:50+02:00' 
  notes:
    - here free notes
  
Each element must contain at least a key NUM
If field NUM is not present, the record is not processed.
If field NUM is empty, the record is not processed.
Other keys must be names of fields in the files of 5-cura-csv/ (case sensitive).

If a key is invalid, a warning is issued and the value is ignored.
One exception : key "build-notes" (lowercase) is ignored while processing.

Dates should be surrounded by quotes (don't know for sure, but in case)

As empty NUM are ignored, a file can safely contain empty models like that :

-
  NUM: 
  FNAME: 
  DATE: ''
  build-notes:
    -
  
As YAML syntax allows free formatted fields, build notes can also be like this :
-
  NUM: 
  FNAME: 
  DATE: ''
  build-notes: |
    Build notes can be multiline
    as long as tabulation is respected
