This directory contains human corrections that should be applied to files of 5-cura-csv/

Each yaml file contains a list of associations key: value

An element of the list looks ike this :

-
  NUM: 
  FNAME: 
  GNAME: 
  notes:
    -
  
Each element must contain at least a key NUM
If field NUM is not present, the record is not processed.
If field NUM is empty, the record is not processed.
Other keys must be names of fields in the files of 5-cura-csv.
If a key is invalid, a warning is issued and the value is ignored.
There is one exception : a field can contain a key noted "notes" (lowercase), ignored while processing.
