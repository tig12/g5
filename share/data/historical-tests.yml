      Extract from 1988-raising-the-hurdle-for-athletes-mars-effect :
      First French. (E-G) The data were first published without planetary
      sectors data, in an appendix to IA, 1955. The section was headed "570
      sportifs" (the number of athletes actually listed was 568). The data were
      again published, with planetary sectors, in A 1 (1 970), with one deletion (an
      erroneous birth date; M. Gauquelin, personal communication, May 10,
      1986)

      New data from Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland
      Gauquelin analyzed a sample of 915 non-French European athletes
      in his HA (1960) study. The data, however, were
      included only in the A 1 collection (1970). Between 1960 and 1970, casual
      data gathering for European athletes continued (N = 274). Subsample No. 2
      increased in size to N = 1189
