Hello, 

I'm a programmer interested to know if it is possible to detect irrational anomalies in the data generated by human activity.
So I started to study the history of statistical tests on astrology : Gauquelin, skeptics, Ertel, Dean.
The first impression is that :
- Gauquelin found results and replicated them.
- Skeptics made interesting objections but cheated to hide and discredit these results.
- Ertel's careful analysis gave precise arguments to show that the statistical effects were present.
- Dean & al. raised a question still open : the effects might be the result of false declaration. This thesis seems "tir√©e par les cheveux" at first sight, but the argument is coherent and despises attention.

- The field is not very active in 2018.

This is only a first impression because I couldn't reproduce the orginal works.
This is an important aspect of the situation : information is not freely available.

To get information about this topic, I had to :
- pay an adhesion to AAA to get the compete collection of Correlation.
- Buy a CD from SCICOP to get the compete collection of Skeptical Inquier.
- Buy the book "The tenacious Mars effect" By Ertel
- Buy the book "The Mars Effect" by Benski et. al.
- Buy the book "Astrological Tests" by Dean et. al.

Several Ertel's arguments were not adressed by skeptics, and this leads to a question : should we associate to scientific dishonesty the names of Paul Kurtz, Jan Wilhem Nienhuys, Science et Vie (a french review) ?
