<h1>Building eminence ranking</h1>
<div class="intro">
The questions are : how to sort the lists of professionals by eminence, split the lists to build sub-groups of same <b>eminence rank</b>. Is it possible to reach a concensus on this process ?
<br>There are many ways to obtain indications about the eminence of a person. These indicators can be combined to build a <b>global rank</b>. This process is partly mechanical, partly human, with the need of human intelligence to perform the meaningful choices.
<br>The subjective (or arbitrary) choices, done by human intelligence, must be identified, debated and accepted as part of the consensus.

<h2><a name="eminence-indicators">Eminence indicators</a></h2>
Given a professional group, the purpose is to associate an eminence rank to each person. To build these associations, one can use many informations at disposition. An example is given by Suitbert Ertel, who counted the number of times a sportsman is cited in a predefined list of books. Other indications for sportsmen could be the palmares in competitions, the presence of sportsmen in web sites.
<br>Each piece of information is called here an <b>eminence indicator</b>.
<br>Indicators are specific to a professional group. For example, Olympic Games palmares can be used to rank sportsmen, but are meaningless to rank painters.
<br>
<br>We have a group of persons, and we want to associate each of them to a rank :

<img class="border margin" src="img/eminence/indicators.jpg" alt="Eminence indicators">

All indicators met so far give a way to sort the persons, which permits to divide the process in two steps :
<ul>
    <li>Use the indicator to sort the persons.</li>
    <li>Use the sort to associate the persons to ranks.</li>
</ul>

<img class="border margin" src="img/eminence/sorted.jpg" alt="Sorted group to eminence ranks">

The process of ranking involves :
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Data</b> considered as meaningful ; their meanings give ways to sort them.
        <br>They can be considered as "objective" (for example, the fact that Olympic Games exist do not depend on one's opinion).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rules</b> :
        <ul>
            <li>The choice of data used as eminence indicators.</li>
            <li>The sorting procedure.</li>
            <li>The way to use the sort to build eminence groups.</li>
        </ul>
        These rules are "subjective", they depend on arbitrary choices done by the persons who build the ranking.
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="1-1-precautions">Precautions</a></h3>

<h4>Divide by periods</h4>
For a given discipline, the available eminence indicators vary with time. For example, Nobel prizes are only relevant for persons active since the beginning of the 20th century. In order to compare what is comparable, the history of each discipline must be divided in coherent periods of time. Major events like world wars can probably be used as period boundaries for most of the disciplines. 

<h4>National bias</h4>
When ranking persons of a given discipline, care must be taken to avoid national bias. For example, if citation count is based on a list of books or web sites, if a particular country is over-represented, there is a risk to over-rate persons of this country.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="1-2-global-ranking">Global ranking</a></h3>
Building a global rank consists in combining several indicators to build a synthesis (see below). This introduces other arbitrary choices :
<ul>
    <li>Choose the number of ranks (Ertel used 5).</li>
    <li>Give the rules to combine the indicators.</li>
</ul>


<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2><a name="exemples-of-eminence-indicators">Exemples of eminence indicators</a></h2>

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="2-1-human-opinion">Human opinion</a></h3>
A specialist or anyone interested by a discipline can rank eminent persons.
<br>One could for example build 3 groups : very eminent (rank 1), eminent (rank 2), moderately eminent (rank 3).
<br>Or maybe still divide in 3 eminence levels, and say that some persons are between rank 1 and 2 and some between rank 2 and 3.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="2-2-citation-count">Citation count</a></h3>
This was done by Suitbert Ertel. Given a list of books, established in advance, count the number of times a person is cited, and use this to build a ranking. 
<br>Ertel's work could be for example reproduced, checked and extended to other disciplines by Google Books.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="2-3-link-count">Link count</a></h3>
In web sites containing biographies of persons of given professional groups, like Wikipedia. Eminence indicators can be built counting hypertext links pointing to the pages of the different persons of a group. This is similar to citation count.
<br>Here are two examples that permit to rank mathematicians :
<ul>
    <li>
        Part of the data available on Wikipedia can be retrieved using <b>Wikidata</b>. One of the fields that Wikidata offers is called <b>linkcount</b>, which is the number of pages pointing to a given page ; this can be used to rank persons. See <a href="wikidata.html">the page about Wikidata</a> for details.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="https://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.html">MacTutor History of Mathematics archive</a> is a site containing biographies of mathematicians. This site does not provide a service similar to Wikidata, but it's possible to use classical data mining technics to extract data from the site and build a sorted list. This was done by a program published on <a href="https://github.com/tig12/mactutor-by-links">github.com/tig12/mactutor-by-links</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="2-4-search-engines">Search engines</a></h3>
An other variant of citation count can be done counting the number of times a given person has been searched for, and the number of clics to a page concerning this person. This could be done for example using Google Trends API (Application Programing Interface). Google Trends does not give the absolute numbers of queries concerning a person, but permits to compare the numbers related to two or more persons, which is sufficient to sort the persons.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="2-5-prizes-awards">Prizes, awards</a></h3>
For example, use Nobel prize lists to associate the laureates with top-level rank (n° 1).
<br>In this case, the associations between persons and ranks could look like this :
<img class="border margin" src="img/eminence/nobel.jpg" alt="Using Nobel prize list to build eminence indicator">

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="2-6-institutions-academies">Institutions, academies</a></h3>
For example, the french Académie des sciences could generate a ranking like this :

<img class="border margin" src="img/eminence/academie-sciences-fr.jpg" alt="Using French Academy of sciences to build eminence indicator">

This example is obtained saying that members are rank n°1 and correspondants are rank n° 2.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="2-7-ranked-lists">Ranked lists</a></h3>
Sites like <a href="https://www.ranker.com">ranker.com</a> provide sorted lists of famous persons which could be used as indicators.

<!-- ********************************************************************************* -->
<h2><a name="building-a-globak-rank">Building a globak rank</a></h2>

The final step is to build a global rank from the different indicators concerning a professional group.
<br>Ther may exist contradictions between indicators, and some indicators may not be reliable. But if indicators are meaningful, it's possible to hope that they will globally go in the same direction, allowing a consensus to emerge.
<br>
<br>For a given professional group, the results of the various indicators can be represented as a table. For example, for mathematicians :

<table class="wikitable margin">
    <tr><th></th><th>Wikidata</th><th>MacTutor</th><th>Field medal</th><th>Historian of sciences 1</th><th>etc.</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <th>person 1</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>person 2</th>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>etc.</th>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>

If there is a coherence between indicators, the following situation could be reached :

<img class="margin border" src="img/eminence/global-rank.jpg" alt="Global eminence ranking">

p<sub>1</sub> ... p<sub>5</sub> represent groups of persons.
<br>Persons in p<sub>1</sub> were associated to rank n° 1.
<br>Persons in both in p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> were associated to rank n° 1 and 2.
<br>
<br>There will probably be exceptions and particular cases, but it seems reasonable to hope that a consensus can be obtained for at least part of the persons of a professional group.

<!-- ************************************* -->
<h3><a name="3-1-remark">Remark</a></h3>

People who study eminence are generally not specialists of the disciplins they process. So the choices of the indicators to use, the rules used to build indicators and the rules used to combine the indicators to build a global ranking should be done with specialists of the different professional groups to rank.
