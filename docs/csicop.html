Results of the U.S. Test of the "Mars Effect" Are Negative
Paul Kurtz, Marvin Zelen, and George Abell
Skeptical Inquier VOL IV NO. 2 WINTER 1979-80
p 21

Canvas 1
-----------
We selected all 340 American champions listed in the Lincoln
Library of Sports Champions (Frontier Press, 1974). We also selected 218
names from Who's Who in Football (Arlington House, 1974), primarily,
but not exclusively, the players who made the All-Star or All-Pro teams,
and 47 All-Star players from Who's Who in Basketball (Arlington House,
1973). Thus our first proposed sample was composed of a total of 605
sports champions. This total was reduced by 41 names for which birth data
were not available in the directories, leaving a total of 564 names.

the actual selection of the champions
was made by two neutral researchers, Frank Dolce and Germain Harnden

Twenty-one states refused to send us information, on the basis of the
Privacy Act, and five states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico, did not reply. Five states had no champions in them, and one state
did not respond to our original request until six months later (those data
were included in our second sample). Nevertheless, 18 states waived the
rule and sent information, from which we compiled data on 128
champions.

We felt that the sample was too
small and M. Gauquelin agreed with this judgment.

Canvas 2
-----------
Accordingly, we decided to expand the sample by requesting
information on more champions from those states that responded to our
first canvass. We selected the remaining champions who resided in those
states and who are listed in Who's Who in Football(330 names) and Who's
Who in Basketball (145 names). This list included many All-Star and All-
Pro players in basketball and football not included in the first sample.
Since we had no idea initially of how much information would be
forthcoming, not all the All-Star and All-Pro players were selected in the
first sample. We also added the names of champions listed in Who's Who
in Track and Field (Arlington, 1973), which contains 111 names of
American champions from those states, and in Who's Who in Boxing
(Arlington, 1974), which contains 92 such champions. We sent requests for
data on these champions to the 18 cooperative states, but received replies
and birth information from only 14 of them. Even those 14 states did not
have records of 186 of the champions. In all, our second canvass yielded
data on 197 additional champions.


Canvas 3
-----------
In a third canvass we wrote to those states initially refusing
information, and from all states we requested data on athletes listed in the
directories but whose names had been omitted in the first and second
canvasses. Three additional states subsequently responded to our second
and third inquiries. The final number of states providing information was
22. From those cooperating states, we requested information on 682. (See
Table 1.) Thus the total sample that resulted from all three canvasses
contains 408 names, a number we deemed large enough for a preliminary
study.
