- refactor group export mechanism
    Group::export() shouldn't store on disk
    Modify articulation between commands/db/export/occu and alloccus (storage should be done in occu)

- check doc of page A with the results of
php run-g5.php cura A1 look count

- better the output of
php run-g5.php cura A1 raw2tmp full
to prepare complete restoration

- check pertinence of
grep -rn '0777' src/

- addGeo (compute geonames) for D10 ?

- See the difference in export of physicians
Counting the nb of unique physicians in each group :
2551 come from A2
976 come from E3
224 come from Muller 1083
2551+977+224 = 3751
The export says 3748, there is a difference of 3 that I can't explain, I marked it as a potential bug to check.

- Update Muller1083 documentation

- Add schema in db config + in all sql queries, specify the schema

- Refactor and unify tweak files :
    - one common mechanism for all tweaks
    - one general README
- tweak2csv : code should be factorized, available to all datafiles
              (cura, 1083MED, 4391SPO)

- cura : handle all cases of unexisting raw files

- Refactor g55 commands : "all" is useless

- Write command export for g55

- G55::prepareCuraMatch not designed correctly

- Harmonize all exports, use commands/csicop/si42/export.php code

- fix nobilities in cura files

- in all cura code, use Cura::tmpFilename()

- Refactor generated filenames : G55570SPO, GQA1, ERT4384SPO, MUL1083MED ?
    adapt doc of 1083MED

- Harmonize POSSIBLE_PARAMS in commands ; use model of muller1083/fixGnr (key val pairs)
  Harmonize messages for wrong parameters

- Use Müller 1083MED to test legal time restoration on serie A

- A : legal time restoration for other countries.

- D6 D10 E1 E3 : compute timezone

- put style.css in conformity with tigsite

- D6 addGeo : add also C2

- E1 notice : "NUM : Number (from 1 to 2145 ; 11 items have been added but n. 285 & n. 1155 are omitted)"
why ?
