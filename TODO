- rename db/fill/ occus and occugroups as occus1 and occus2

- integrate muller 1083 fix cura days and names to db/fill/history

- AFD2: 

    - check 17  Arrau, Claudio (south lat)
    - check 202 Franz II., Joseph Karl (-.50) tz offset (instead of -0.50)
    - case 34 Bastian Adolf  1826-06-26 00:30 / 1826-06-25 23:54:40 for Gauquelin
      (both correct but legal to UT make day change).
    - 182 Gabriel Fauré => Gauquelin / Müller dates differ => check civil registries
    - 456 Quadflieg, Will A5-1225 => Gauquelin / Müller dates differ => check civil registries
    - 23  Balla, Giacomo is born 19.07.1871, but 18.07 according to wikipedia
    - 102 Cage, John => Gauquelin / Müller dates differ => check civil registries
    - try to match with Gauquelin
        - MU: 162      Duvivier Julien
        - MU: 384      Messerschmitt Willy
        - MU: 292      Junkers Hugo

- AFD3: 
    - refactor using common code with AFD2
    - check if mb_substr is needed
    - simplify name (remove name2 and 3)

- E1 E3 / 'L' => compagnon de la libération

- A2 : Auguste /Jean Piccard: who is who ?
    Associated A A2-3343 and J A2-3344 to match astrotheme.fr data (A: 23h - J: 22h45)
    But possible error: astrotheme.fr hours differ from cura, need to check civil registry.
    The association is done in tmp2db of Muller AFD2 312 famous men.
    
- Check :
    GQ: A2-1462  Gayda Tullio                            1882-10-19 05:55:04 ROMA
    GQ: A3-1697  Gauquelin-A3-1697                       1882-10-19 20:10:04 ROMA

- in all tmp2db, when $p->addHistory is done,
    $p->addSource and $p->addIdInSource are not taken into account

- Add sources for all historical groups

- review person name structure in src/model/Person.yml
  Implement precisely for all groups

- refactor group export mechanism
    Group::export() shouldn't store on disk
    Modify articulation between commands/db/export/occu and alloccus (storage should be done in occu)

- check doc of page A with the results of
php run-g5.php cura A1 look count

- better the output of
php run-g5.php cura A1 raw2tmp full
to prepare complete restoration

- check pertinence of
grep -rn '0777' src/

- addGeo (compute geonames) for D10 ?

- See the difference in export of physicians
Counting the nb of unique physicians in each group :
2551 come from A2
976 come from E3
224 come from Muller 1083
2551+977+224 = 3751
The export says 3748, there is a difference of 3 that I can't explain, I marked it as a potential bug to check.

- Update Muller1083 documentation

- Add schema in db config + in all sql queries, specify the schema

- Refactor and unify tweak files :
    - one common mechanism for all tweaks
    - one general README
- tweak2csv : code should be factorized, available to all datafiles
              (cura, 1083MED, 4391SPO)

- cura : handle all cases of unexisting raw files

- Refactor g55 commands : "all" is useless

- Write command export for g55

- G55::prepareCuraMatch not designed correctly

- fix nobilities in cura files

- in all cura code, use Cura::tmpFilename()

- Refactor generated filenames : G55570SPO, GQA1, ERT4384SPO, MUL1083MED ?
    adapt doc of 1083MED

- Harmonize POSSIBLE_PARAMS in commands ; use model of muller1083/fixGnr (key val pairs)
  Harmonize messages for wrong parameters

- Use Müller 1083MED to test legal time restoration on serie A

- A : legal time restoration for other countries.

- D6 D10 E1 E3 : compute timezone

- put style.css in conformity with tigsite

- D6 addGeo : add also C2

- E1 notice : "NUM : Number (from 1 to 2145 ; 11 items have been added but n. 285 & n. 1155 are omitted)"
why ?
